This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS 
Word documents. The following is just a sample of some of the things you can do with R Markdown.

## R Markdown Coding Tips

Markdown is an **easy to use** format for writing reports. It resembles what you naturally write every 
time you compose an email. In fact, you may have already used markdown *without realizing it*. 
These websites all rely on markdown formatting

### Chunks of Code

It is always a good idea to include titles for your chunks of R code. This allows other users to quickly 
find the code you may be referencing when working with other developers. Additionally, within 
each chunk of code, there is a number of options for how your code will be handled when you knit 
a file. These are can be included in “{r }” where you include the title. 

**Options include: **

* **eval = FALSE** prevents the code from being evaluate (not run and no output created). This is 
useful if you want to stop a chunk of code from running but you will probably not use this in 
the course. 
* **include = FALSE** runs the code, but doesn’t show the code or results in the final document. 
Use for setup code that you don’t want cluttering your report. 
* **echo = FALSE** prevents code (but not results) from appearing in the finished report. Useful 
when presenting to management so the code doesn’t show on report. 
* **message = FALSE** or **warning = FALSE** prevents messages or warnings from appearing in the 
output file 
* **results = ‘hide’** hides printed output. 
* **fig.show = ‘hide’** hides plots. 
* **error = TRUE** causes the render to continue even if the code returns an error (rarely used). 

**While these are useful options, most of the time for this class I would like to see your code and 
results so please use these options sparingly.** 


### Packages and Data Imports in R 


A good habit is to include all the libraries and data import statements at the beginning of your R 
Markdown document. This is commonly the first chunk of code that you create in the Markdown 
file. 

A few tips when working with packages in Markdown include: 

* Don’t install a package in your Markdown file. This will install the package everytime the file is 
knit. To load new packages, do this in the console outside of the Markdown file. 
* If a new package does need to be installed, include this in the comments at the top of your R 
Markdown file. 
* You only need to load the library once in the Markdown file. So, if you are using tidyverse, you 
will only have library(tidyverse) included once at the beginning. 
* When you load some packages, they actually have multiple packages included in the load. For 
example, when you load tidyverse, this will load ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, etc. 


### Examples


For this project, we will be using the tidyverse which you just installed in a previous assignment. 
Remember that when you load a package in R, it will remain loaded throughout the program (you 
don’t need to continually load the package). 

Below is an example of loading the package and importing the data: 


```{r Packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
US_Population <- read_csv("US_Population.csv")
#View(US_Population)
US_Population
```
